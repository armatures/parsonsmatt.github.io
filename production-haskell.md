I'm the author of a book "Production Haskell" - a distillation of my (at time of writing) seven years of experience writing Haskell in industry.

To get updates on the book, follow [@prodhaskell](https://twitter.com/prodhaskell) on Twitter!

The e-book is available for purchase at [the Production Haskell Leanpub site](https://leanpub.com/production-haskell).

The book is also available as a hardcover, softcover, and Kindle from [Amazon (note: referral link)](https://amzn.to/3ZdkGqH) .
