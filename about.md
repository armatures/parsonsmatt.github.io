Hi! I’m Matt Parsons!
I like to ride my bicycle, play guitar, and occasionally program a computer.
I work as a software engineer for Mercury.

I started learning a software in Spring 2014 in my "intro to Java" course at UGA.
JavaScript introduced me to functional programming that summer, and Ruby on Rails pointed me towards Sandi Metz and Smalltalk-inspired object oriented design.
Haskell caught my interest and I started learning it in earnest in early 2015.
Ever since, I've been sold on functional programming.

I tend to like abstraction, patterns, extremes in contrast, and going a little too meta.
There’s an underpinning to writing music, learning mathematics, and making beautiful programs that resonate with me.
Emergent complexity, chaotic systems, and expressions of passion are my favorite things.
