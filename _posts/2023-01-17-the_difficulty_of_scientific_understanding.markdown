> Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself. The principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.

I love this quote.
Dr. Feynman was one of the most brilliant people of the prior century. 
Had he coasted on his intelligence, he would have easily been the smartest person in the room - and been satisfied with that.
Had he been afraid of being wrong, he would have avoided challenges to his ego and intelligence.
His growth would be stunted, and he would not have accomplished as much as he did.

He recognized the incredible virtue of humility, both epistemic and intellectual.
Epistemic humility relates to the field of philosophy known as "epistemology," which studies and considers the question: "How do we know things? What does it mean to know something?"
Intellectual humility is a step beyond that - even once you *know* something, you may still be wrong about what it *means*.

The scientific understanding of the world is inherently a *filtering* mechanism.
There exist some hypotheses.
You perform Science on them, and some of the hypotheses become less likely.
Eventually, you're left with a single hypothesis that explains everything we've currently experienced or imagined.

The scientific method is *not* a generative mechanism.
You may be inspired while observing reality, and create a hypothesis - but that's not the scientific part.
When you attempt to eliminate that hypothesis, *that's* the science.

> How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?

The scientific method has filtered a staggering amount of incorrect guesses about how the world works.
The modern information age is the result of the remaining hypotheses being applied and industrialized.
The remarkable success of this method has valorized science and scientific understanding, to the point that any other form of knowledge is discredited.

The popular attitude is that, for something to be *real*, to be worthy of *respect*, it must be science.
Disciplines which are distinctly *not* scientific have dressed themselves in the formal regalia of science.
An optimist would claim that these disciplines were simply trying to improve their own methodology, and didn't understand that the scientific method wasn't an appropriate tool.
A pessimest would claim that they're just doing it for the funding and the social status.

The result of these misapplications of the scientific method are *bad* - we develop a false sense of *epistemic confidence* in ideas because we've *fooled ourselves with the appearance of having done science*.
Complex systems, like nutrition, sociology, climate, and economics, simply aren't suited to the "change a variable and observe a change" process of traditional science.
Instead, we must rely on sophisticated statistical methods and observational experiments to attempt to gain any understanding at all.
If "you are the easiest person to fool," then statistics is the easiest tool with which to fool yourself.

I chose the above four topics because we've seen big shifts in the "scientific understanding" over the last century.
At the same time that Science was sending human beings to the moon, [it was promoting sugar and demonizing fat](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493739074/50-years-ago-sugar-industry-quietly-paid-scientists-to-point-blame-at-fat) - a concept that has been since entirely discredited.
There was concern about [global cooling in the 1970s](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-global-cooling-story-came-to-be/) (global warming is, by all available forms of knowledge, a massive problem, regardless of the flip-flop in scientific understanding).
Sociology [used scientific language to promote eugenics](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Eugenics-and-Scientific-Racism), which the scientific establishment now roundly (and rightly) rejects.
Economics is a particularly good example - even today, various schools of economists believe totally different theories of how and why economies do what they do, and none have emerged as a clear winner.

Logic and rationality are tied in to science, despite being *total opposites*, because they share similar criteria for applicability.
In order to use logic, a system must be sufficiently simple to be accurately modeled.
You model the real world in the logical system.
There, you can apply logical transformations to the system.
Once you're happy with how the system looks, you can translate *back* to the real world.
If the real world doesn't match the system, then your *model* or your *translation* must be wrong.

Logical models that have easy translation rules and are simple enough to do interesting transformations with tend to also model real world phenomena that are amenable to the scientific method.
You observe something in the real world.
You model it logically, and apply a logical transformation to the system.
Then, you hypothesize what happens in the real world.
If the model and the real world agree, then you have some evidence that your model is good.
If the model and the real world disagree, then you have great evidence that your model is wrong.

Sociology doesn't work like that.
You simply can't isolate all relevant variables and perform an experiment.
Even if it *were* ethical, there's simply no way to control all the possible things that can influence it.
Scientific understandings of these fields tend to be weaker and less useful than other forms of knowledge.

# Relevancy to Software Engineering

"Computer Science" is also guilty of the appropriation of the scientific method.
The name is misleading - we don't do science.
Most of what "computer scientists" do is some mix of mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and mysticism.

Yet, we try to be scientific.
We perform "scientific studies" of programming techniques, paradigms, and other things.
However, these studies tend to look much more like the faulty and unreliable studies from sociology and psychology than the reliable studies from chemistry and biology.
As a result, you can find scientific evidence for virtually any position you want to hold.
