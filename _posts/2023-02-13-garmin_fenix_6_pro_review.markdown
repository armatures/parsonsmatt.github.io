I've been pondering a smart watch for tracking more of my daily activity and health, as well as getting some metrics on my non-cycling workouts.
I had narrowed the field down to the Fitbit Charge, Apple Watch SE, and Garmin Fenix 6.
The Fenix seemed like the winner - awesome battery life, navigation, and even music on board.
However, even at a discount, it's $450, so it must be *awesome* to be worthwhile.

tl;dr: Garmin's *anticooperative* features are a dealbreaker.

# The Good 

The watch comes in three sizes, and the 6s doesn't look *too* big on my wrist, despite having small wrists.

The Body Battery and sleep tracking are pretty good.
Over the past three weeks or so of owning the Fenix, the Body Battery has dialed in to how I'm physically feeling, and I can pretty well tune my workouts and daily activities based on the recommendations.

The pulse oximeter has been interesting for tracking sleep - when I wear a nose strip, my blood oxygen level is higher overnight.
This is actionable and useful information, though I already knew that a nose strip helps a lot for sleep quality.

The device appears to be very rugged.
The lack of touch screen is a *plus* to me - I don't like the idea of accidentally touching or disabling things.
The button interface is a bit clunky, but overall feels reliable and secure, even when operating with gloves.

The battery life is excellent, so long as you're not downloading music or maps or navigating.

# The Bad

Garmin has a reputation for being *anticooperative*.
Their devices, software, etc, have always blocked features that would be extremely useful if they think they can sell you anothe device or service.
They *desperately* want to be your only interface into the fitness world.
In that sense, they're a lot like Apple.

But *unlike* Apple, you don't build your lifestyle around your *fitness devices*.
I own a Wahoo bike computer and a Withings smart scale.
Garmin *explicitly* is not compatible with these devices.
Garmin *explicitly* chooses to not support syncing workouts from Strava to calculate "training readiness," and they explicitly don't sync weight *from* Apple Health.
They want you to record workouts using Garmin Connect, and they want you to buy a Garmin smart scale.

They *used to* support API workout uploads, so you could sync from Strava to Garmin using a third party.
However, they recently disabled this.
And - even if you *could* upload Strava workouts - they don't count for the "Training Readiness" score that the app gives you.

Some more annoyances:

- You can't do firmware update over the phone. You need to plug in to a Windows or Mac computer. My computers are all Ubuntu, so this is a bad deal. I've read some reports that WINE can do it, but I'm not sure I want to put the firmware on a $450 device up to WINE and Garmin's programmers.
- The music download feature is broken. I tried to download a playlist to the watch, and it burned the battery from 60% to dead in about 20 minutes. It didn't even download anything.
- Activity tracking and options are overwhelming, but "track activites automatically" doesn't work - it never registered a bike ride as a bike ride.

# The Choice

So, Garmin presents a bargain:

> The Fenix is a fantastic watch for adventure and activity.
> But for you to really get the full benefit, you need to switch to Garmin Connect, and Garmin smart scale, and use Garmin for everything.
> Yeah, that includes tossing your Wahoo bike computer and buying a Garmin.
> 
> Once you do that, you'll get Training Status, Body Battery, and other useful training tools.

The bargain is... expensive.
The Garmin smart scale is more expensive than the Withings by a large amount, and per reviews, it's not even as good.
The Garmin bike computers are *way* worse than Wahoo, IME, and the cheaper ones have arbitrary software locks (like not being able to sync a route over Bluetooth).
Furthermore, you *know* you're signing up for a closed ecosystem that will never cooperate with anything else.

This sort of ecosystem lock is comparable to what Apple is trying to do, but at a much smaller niche.
For the most part, Apple's ecosystem lock is about *adding* functionality.
One Apple device is *quite useful*, and doesn't really do anything to explicitly block compatibility.
Sure, the Apple Watch only works on iPhone.
But you can use a Fitbit or any other smart watch with the iPhone.
You don't *need* a Macbook to use an iPhone or iPad.

Garmin, on the other hand, explicitly denies compatibility with other devices.
Wahoo and Garmin don't talk to each other.
Wahoo is perfectly happy to talk to basically every other company - but Garmin won't allow it.
Garmin won't even *read data* from Apple Health, if it can provide a slight edge to selling a product.

# The Alternatives

[DC Rainmaker has a great guide to GPS sport watches](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/11/best-gps-sport-smartwatches-recommendations-guide-2021.html).
I selected the Fenix as the "best choice" in the Hiking/Adventure watch, since I see myself as an "adventurer."

The COROS Vertix is the other recommendation in the category.
That gives you the [EvoLab "Training Load Metrics"](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/05/coros-rolls-out-evolab-revamped-training-load-metrics-a-detailed-explainer.html), which should be a nice competitor to "Body Battery."
It also gives a much better battery life - 60 hours - instead of the 24/36 from Garmin.
However, at $500, it also seems like more of a "specialized/primary tool for runners/hikers," and realistically, I'm a cyclist - my bike computer will be my go-to device for *most* activity I do.

The Apple Watch SE seems to give *most* of the same featureset as the Garmin, with the main downside being battery life.
However, the watch charges pretty quickly, and a habit of charging every day is pretty much what I've settled into with the Garmin.
It's also one of the cheapest options to provide mapping and navigation, and the WatchOS platform supports a bunch of apps like RideWithGPS and Hiking Project.

The Fitbit Charge is considerably cheaper, and is *only* a basic activity/sleep tracker.
If you don't want any smartwatch features, then this may be a good bet.

I'm boxing up and returning the Fenix today, and I've got an order in for the Apple Watch SE.
