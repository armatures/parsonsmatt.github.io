I want a power meter on my gravel bike.

Well, I currently have a Shimano crankset with a Stages power meter installed, but the asymmetrical crankset design means that the power meter is *really* unreliable.
So I should say I want a *different* power meter on my gravel bike.

I've now owned three major kinds of power meters:

* Left-side crank arms (Stages)
* Spider (power2max NGeco)
* Pedal (Garmin Rally XC 100)

Let's get into the pros and cons of each.

Generally speaking, there are three main factors I will be considering:

* Ease of installation/removal: can you easily transfer between bikes? or is this a "only when selling the bike" situation?
* Ease of use and accuracy: do you just ride the bike, or do you need to fiddle with it?
* Cost, including resale 

# Left side crank arm power meters

These are great.
Around $300-400 and you've got power data.
I've generally found the Stages to be pretty reliable and easy to work with, and the data appears to be highly internally consistent and accurate when comparing to my Saris H3 trainer.

The primary disadvantage is that they eat into the clearance between your left crank arm and left chainstay.
Less clearance means more opportunity for mud, rocks, and other problems to accumulate there, potentially damaging the bike.
But the *real* dealbreaker, for my application, is that my bike simply doesn't have the clearance.
I'd need a different crankset with a wider Q-factor to make this work out.
Now, I *do* intend on selling the crankset - the power meter is built into the crankset, and I don't want to have a redundant part sitting here and not paying rent - but I don't want a wider crankset that is less efficient for the task.

A note on that - Shimano cranks have been using their splined and 2-bolt interface "Hollowtech II" for a while now.
Technically speaking, any Shimano left-crank will work on a Hollowtech II spindle.
The main difference is in the shape and Q-factor of the resulting crankset.
While you can mate an Ultegra or 105 left crank arm to an XT spindle, you'll have an uneven shape, which may be weird for fit.
I've put a 105 crank on a GRX crankset with no issues.

If you *can* run a left crank arm power meter, then you should.
They're a great choice and pretty cheap.
You won't be transfering power meters regularly - but it's not a huge deal to replace the power meter before you sell the bike, allowing you to (mostly) retain your investment provided that the next bike has the same crank system.

Resale and used-market is a bit tricky here, since folks generally want specific lengths and to match their cranks.
If you want a 165mm GRX power meter crankset - that's a decent amount of filters.

# Spider

The power2max NGeco is what I've run on several different bikes - I've owned two of them, and one has migrated with my touring/adventure biking rig.
These have excellent power meter data, as well as a cadence sensor - nice, I guess.

Spider based power meters require compatibility with a certain crankset interface in order to work.
If you buy a power spider for a SRAM or Rotor crankset, then you can swap it easily between other cranksets with the same interface.
This makes transfering between bikes relatively straightforward - you only need to replace the spider with a non-power one.
Howevwer, you're unlikely to want to do this except for when you sell the bike - so it's not really transferrable.

The spider power meter costs around $500.
However, since there are few variables - just the mating interface with the crankset - it's relatively easy to find them used.
It's also easy to sell them.
They're small and ship easily.

Indeed, I can get the power2mag Gran Fondo power meter crankset as a direct replacement for my Shimano cranks, and the total cost is $610 assembled and shipped.
This includes the 165mm crank arms, and I can reuse the Shimano chainrings.
This is the lowest cost option, since I can't really use the left-crank-arm.

If the spider doesn't have a compatible BCD for the rings you use, then you'll need to buy new chainrings.
This is a potentially expensive choice.

# Pedal-based power meter

I have a Garmin Rally XC 100 power meter on my mountain bike.
It's *very* convenient to install and remove, so I feel 100% confident that I'll be taking this power meter with me even if I sell the mountain bike.
I could also feasibly run this pedal on several different bikes - removing and swapping pedals isn't a huge deal, and the *true* lowest cost option is to just swap the bike that gets the "data pedal" for the one I'm doing a training (vs fun) ride on.

Unfortunately, the power data is pretty unreliable.
You need to do a calibration on every single ride - otherwise it reports numbers that are absurdly high.
This adds a bit more fuss than just "Get on the bike and ride."

At $700 for the single sided power data, and the frustration of calibrating every use, *and* the general feeling that the power data just isn't as reliable, this is the most expensive option and the least convenient for the "on the bike" time.
If you don't mind swapping pedals and calibrating every ride, and you have lots of bikes that you want power data for, then this makes a lot of sense.
If you want to minimize the fuss of riding a bike, then you may want to look elsewhere.

# Conclusion

Left-side crank power meters are cheap and work great, if they fit on the bike.

Spider power meters are slightly more expensive, but work great.
They're easier to source used and resell, so an incompatible meter with a new bike isn't as bad of a financial loss.

Pedal-based power meters are very expensive and quite finicky, but they may pay for themselves if you have a large stable of bikes that you want power data on.
They're compatible with any bike that uses pedals, so you won't have compatibility concerns.
