    <h2>Software and other thoughts</h2>
    <p>
I'm Matt Parsons. I've been writing Haskell professionally since
2016, and that's the main reason that you may be interested in this website.
You can find an index of my <a href="/programming/">programming posts</a>, though the condensed knowledge in Haskell programming is found in my book, <a href="https://leanpub.com/production-haskell">Production Haskell</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
Since this domain lives on my real name, I'm planning on reorganizing the website to be more about my real self.
Expect posts on other topics here.
If this bothers you, then consider subscribing to <a href="https://overcomingsoftware.substack.com/">my Substack, 'Overcoming Software'</a>.
